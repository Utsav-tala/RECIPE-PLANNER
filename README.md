Problem Statement:-
Managing a diverse collection of recipes, planning meals, and providing
nutritional information can be complex and time-consuming. This is particularly
true for food bloggers, nutritionists and meal prep services, who need to cater
to various dietary needs and preferences. The primary challenges include
organizing recipes, creating personalized meal plans, and offering seasonal and
time-based recipe recommendations, along with efficient user and subscription
management.
